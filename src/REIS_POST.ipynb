    "### 1. Case Description\n",
    "\n",
    "***Motivation***\n",
    "\n",
    "*This project focuses on analyzing bank personal loan data to develop predictive models that can enhance the decision-making process in retail banking. In today's competitive banking environment, accurately assessing loan applications and determining appropriate loan amounts is crucial for both risk management and customer satisfaction. By leveraging machine learning techniques, banks can potentially automate and improve their loan approval processes while maintaining prudent risk management practices.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***Research Questions***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Loan Approval Prediction:*\n",
    "   - Can we accurately predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer based on their demographic and financial characteristics?\n",
    "   - Which customer attributes are the most significant predictors of loan acceptance?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Maximum Loan Amount Estimation:*\n",
    "   - What is the optimal maximum loan amount that can be safely offered to different customer segments?\n",
    "   - How do factors such as income, education level, and existing financial obligations influence the recommended loan amount?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Customer Segmentation:*\n",
    "   - Are there distinct customer profiles that emerge from the data?\n",
    "   - How do different customer segments vary in their loan acceptance patterns and creditworthiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Risk Assessment:*\n",
    "   - What combination of factors indicates higher or lower risk in personal loan customers?\n",
    "   - How can we balance maximizing loan approvals while minimizing potential defaults?\n",
    "\n",
    "*This analysis aims to provide insights that could help banks optimize their personal loan offerings while maintaining appropriate risk levels and improving customer targeting strategies.*\n"

    "   - The models can effectively segment customers for targeted loan marketing\n",
    "   - Risk assessment is well-balanced, considering both income and existing obligations\n",
